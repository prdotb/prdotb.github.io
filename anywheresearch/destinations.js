You can easily spend a day hiking through its many trees and remains of historical buildings. Or you can spot the many rare birds as they migrate to the wetland area, making it a great place to test your wildlife photography skills as well.</p><h3>Get under the surface</h3><p>There are always places you can learn to dive at coastal resorts, but they’re not always as well-reviewed as Acqua Life Dive Center. Not only will you get the chance to see unusual sea creatures up close, you’ll also be coached by a funny and caring team that make sure you’re in safe hands as you take the plunge.</p><h3>Full steam ahead!</h3><p>For a fun and low-cost way to get around the area, hop on the Minitrenit. This little train is ideal for families, or anyone who would like to take in the sights without too much walking in between. It can be a bit of a bumpy ride, but that’s all part of the charm!</p><h3>Get the massage</h3><p>To take your destressing to the next level, book yourself in with Quincho Massages for a solo or couple’s treatment. They work their magic in a truly relaxing setting with natural beauty all around, and they’re super friendly too.</p>",

Show off your best haggling skills and you can grab authentic goodies even on a cheap holiday to Hurghada.</p><h3>Sand Dune Safari</h3><p>One of the pros of being in Egypt is the Sahara Desert practically on your doorstep, it'd be rude not to make an expedition and live out your Brendan Fraiser in 'The Mummy', fantasy - hop on a camel or buckle up your helmet and zoom off into the sunset on a quad bike.</p>",

Spain’s biggest waterpark is serving up thrills, spills, and top-tier fun for all ages.</p><h3>Jeep treking, safari style</h3><p>One part nature ride, one part mountain adventure. We all love the beach, but we all love a cheeky excursion too, and this is deffo not one to be missed. This is your chance to see Spain from a completely different angle, zooming through valleys, villages lost to time, deep canyons, and maybe even a cheeky waterfall for a swim in stunning turquoise waters. This is the perfect day out for families with kids who crave some thrills, or you and your mates to trade the day drinking for water fights and let that inner child roam free for a few hours.</p><h3>Terra Mítica</h3><p>History lesson? Nah, more like history-level-up! Terra Mítica’s Mediterranean zones bring ancient civilisations to life with epic rides and attractions. Zoom past Egyptian pyramids on rollercoasters, make a splash on log flumes near Greek temples, or brave river rapids by Roman amphitheatres. It’s a history-packed adventure with a side of adrenaline. If school was this fun, we’d all have a degree in thrills.</p><h3>Sierra Helada Natural Park</h3><p>Looking to swap your swimmers for hiking boots? Sierra Helada Natural Park is calling. This coastal paradise serves up cliffside trails with views so stunning, you’ll be snapping pics like a pro. Whether you’re after a peaceful wander or a proper trek, the park’s paths lead you to gems like the iconic Albir lighthouse. It’s all fresh sea air, Mediterranean vistas, and a slice of nature - just what you need to recharge after the buzz of Benidorm</p><h3>Benidorm Old Town</h3><p>If cobbled streets, quaint shops, and stunning Spanish architecture sound like your thing, Benidorm Old Town has your name written all over it. Meander through the maze of alleys, find historic gems, and hit up local tapas bars. And don’t worry—beaches, buzzing restaurants, and a cheeky sangria pit stop are never far away.

The Balcony of the Mediterranean, or Benidorm Castle to some, is a stunning spot sure to have your Insta followers swooning just as much as you will when you're standing at the edge of the crisp white railings looking out over the lush, blue Mediterranean Sea. It's a spot that makes you wish you were the star of a rom-com and this was the big proposal moment... it's not just us that dream about that kinda thing, right?</p>",

Full of bars, cafés and shops selling a bit of everything, it's a great spot to have a wander and kill a few hours in the sunshine.</p><h3>Take movie night outside</h3><p>Open-air cinemas are becoming all the rage, but let's be honest - it's not exactly something we can rely on back home (thanks, weather). The one in Playa de las Americas is the only permanent outdoor cinema in Tenerife, showing all the best movies under the stars, and providing two language options for each film, plus comfy headphones so you can really enjoy the experience.</p><h3>Get your (mini) golf on</h3><p>Who doesn't love mini golf?! Well, maybe Dad when the kids thrash him again, but it's all about the taking part - right? ViVO Mini Golf Treasure Island is one of the best mini golf courses in Playa de las Americas, with buggy-friendly ramps, miniature clubs for the little ones, shaded picnic tables for a break between holes, and even an on-site bar dishing up  delish snacks and drinks. It's open from 9AM 'til midnight too, so you can swing by (see what we did there?) whenever suits.</p><h3>Make a splash at Siam Park</h3><p>The infamous Siam Park is just a half-hour walk or 5-minute drive from Playa de las Americas, and it's decked out with rapid rides, lazy rivers, adrenaline-pumping waterslides and wave pools that'll have the whole fam squealing with joy. And don't worry, if you're more of a Bag Watcher (someone's gotta do it!), there are even VIP cabanas where you can chill out in the shade with a glass of champers. Proper boujee.</p><h3>Spot dolphins (and other finned friends)</h3><p>Can't go wrong with a bit of dolphin-spotting, and thankfully, Playa de las Americas has plenty of boat trips calling your name. Book yourself onto one that takes your fancy, and you'll be cruising right alongside dolphins, whales and even turtles if you're lucky! It's like a scene from Finding Nemo. Plus, some boat tours even provide food and drinks on board, so you can really get comfy.</p><h3>Escape the heat</h3><p>An Escape Room might sound like a weird thing to do on holiday, but why the heck not? It's fun, it's a way to keep cool, and it's proper crowd-pleasing entertainment. Everyone's raving about Escape Rooms Island Phobia (seriously, check out their TripAdvisor page), decked out with six high-quality escape rooms - including a Jumanji-themed room, a horror-themed room, and a bank robbery set-up.

Para gliding and windsurfing are extremely popular activities, so expect to see the sea dotted with thrill seekers, but if you're inclined to a less strenuous activity, a ride in a boat or a dinghy is a great choice.</p><h3>Culture</h3><p>Like Rhodes town, Ixia is a location with a wonderful history, so lovers of Greek history will be pleased. For the most informative and engaging sights, head to Lalysos, which is an extremely important archaeological site. Once there, you'll be able to view the amazing ruins of the temple of Zeus and Athena Poliada - a sight that is sure to excite young and old minds alike.</p><h3>Nightlife</h3><p>For younger people, the amenities of a larger place like Rhodes Town will perhaps provide a more lively evening out, but that's not to say that Ixia doesn't have charms of its own. Most hotels will provide a great evening of entertainment, but if you feel like venturing out, the centre of town is undoubtedly the best place to go. There you'll find taverns and restaurants providing great Greek food and music. It's also good idea to take a trip down at sunset - as the sun descends from the sky and Ixia gets dark, the restaurants and bars will turn on their lights and illuminate the entire street, which makes for a truly dazzling sight.</p>",

Whenever you come, be sure to check out the local Sunday market at Teguise, replete with folk music and hand-made treasures being plied from numerous local vendors.</p><h3>Nightlife</h3><p>Costa Teguise holidays will see you enjoying the typical Canarian nightlife: eclectic and vivacious, but not overly noisy or wild. You can visit the local seafood restaurants and Canarian bars for a true taste of Lanzarote's culture, or the numerous pubs and clubs more tailored to the British market. Dance the night away in the disco and nightclubs, or take an evening stroll down the promenade past the seaside tavernas silhouetted by the sunsets.
