You can easily spend a day hiking through its many trees and remains of historical buildings. Or you can spot the many rare birds as they migrate to the wetland area, making it a great place to test your wildlife photography skills as well.</p><h3>Get under the surface</h3><p>There are always places you can learn to dive at coastal resorts, but they’re not always as well-reviewed as Acqua Life Dive Center. Not only will you get the chance to see unusual sea creatures up close, you’ll also be coached by a funny and caring team that make sure you’re in safe hands as you take the plunge.</p><h3>Full steam ahead!</h3><p>For a fun and low-cost way to get around the area, hop on the Minitrenit. This little train is ideal for families, or anyone who would like to take in the sights without too much walking in between. It can be a bit of a bumpy ride, but that’s all part of the charm!</p><h3>Get the massage</h3><p>To take your destressing to the next level, book yourself in with Quincho Massages for a solo or couple’s treatment. They work their magic in a truly relaxing setting with natural beauty all around, and they’re super friendly too.</p>",
